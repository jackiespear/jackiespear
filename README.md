I hold a PhD in Cognitive Science, with a strong background in data science, statistics, and experimental research. My work combines computational modelling, behavioural experimentation, and quantitative analysis to investigate how humans learn, decide, and remember (or falsely remember). I program primarily in R and JavaScript, with experience in data wrangling, visualization, reproducible analysis, and building interactive research tools.

I also bring extensive experience as an educator—teaching research methods and statistics, and skill-based training programs in both academic and applied settings.

Outside my academic work, I have a long history of contributing to high-performance sailing. I’ve contributed to national skill development through leadership, coach education, and curriculum review, including serving as an expert reviewer for CANSail 2.0 and helping develop Sail Canada’s national foiling curriculum. With over 22 years of coaching experience, I’ve supported youth and provincial athletes at major national events, including the Canada Summer Games.

While I stepped into the role of Executive Director of Sail Manitoba during the final stages of my PhD, my GitHub projects remain centred on my scientific and technical interests: Data analysis, cognitive modelling, experimental programming. 

🚀 I’m dedicated to advancing rigorous, data-driven work while fostering a culture of excellence.
🌱 Committed to continuous learning and helping others grow through mentorship and collaboration.
